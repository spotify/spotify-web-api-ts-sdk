description: Override existing functionality.

All of the constructors support a configuration object that lets you override the default behavior of the SDK.

Our defaults look like this, and each of the properties is optional, and can be overridden.

```ts
const defaultConfig: SdkConfiguration = {
  fetch: (req: RequestInfo | URL, init: RequestInit | undefined) =>
    fetch(req, init),
  beforeRequest: (_: string, __: RequestInit) => {},
  afterRequest: (_: string, __: RequestInit, ___: Response) => {},
  deserializer: new DefaultResponseDeserializer(),
  responseValidator: new DefaultResponseValidator(),
  errorHandler: new NoOpErrorHandler(),
  redirectionStrategy: new DocumentLocationRedirectionStrategy(),
  cachingStrategy: isBrowser
    ? new LocalStorageCachingStrategy()
    : new InMemoryCachingStrategy(),
};
```

As a general rule, this options should be overridden when you create your instance of the client, and you probably won't have to change any of them unless you have some very specific requirements.

You can provide the options like this, to any of the constructors or static initilisation methods:

```js
const opts = {
  fetch: (req, init) => {
    console.log("Called via my custom fetch!");
    return fetch(req, init);
  },
};

const sdk = SpotifyApi.withUserAuthorization(
  "client-id",
  "https://callback",
  ["scope1"],
  opts
);
```

All the below examples are in TypeScript, but the same method signatures all apply to JavaScript - just without the Type information.

### fetch

You can override the default Fetch implementation by passing in a function that takes a `RequestInfo` and `RequestInit` and returns a `Promise<Response>`. By default, we use the browser and nodes built in `fetch` implementation.

```js
const opts = {
  fetch: (req, init) => {
    // Do something with the request
    return fetch(req, init);
  },
};
```

### beforeRequest and afterRequest

You can override the default `beforeRequest` and `afterRequest` callbacks by passing in functions that take a `RequestInfo` and `RequestInit` and return nothing. By default, we do nothing.

You can use these functions to implement custom instrumentation, logging, or other functionality.

```js
const opts = {
  beforeRequest: (req, init) => {
    console.log("Called before the request is made");
  },
  afterRequest: (req, init, res) => {
    console.log("Called after the request is made");
  },
};
```

### deserializer

You can override the default deserializer by passing in a class that implements the `IResponseDeserializer` interface. By default, we use the `DefaultResponseDeserializer` class.

To implement your own, you need to provide an object with the following method signature:

```ts
async deserialize<TReturnType>(response: Response): Promise<TReturnType> {
    // Implement your custom deserialization logic here
}
```

You'll probably never need to do this unless you feel the need to add custom logging around deserialization behaviour or wish to customise the default objects returned during serialization failures.

### responseValidator

You can override the default response validator by passing in a class that implements the `IValidateResponses` interface. By default, we use the `DefaultResponseValidator` class.

Our default impelementation validates the following:

- The response status code is in the 200 range
- Errors are thrown for 400 and 500 range status codes
- Non-200 response codes throw errors with the API response body inside of them

If you need to customise this behaviour, replace the implementation like this:

```ts
export default class MyResponseValidator implements IValidateResponses {
  public async validateResponse(response: Response): Promise<void> {
    // Something here
  }
}
```

### errorHandler

You can override the default error handler by passing in a class that implements the `IHandleErrors` interface. By default, we use the `NoOpErrorHandler` class which... does nothing!

If you need to customise this behaviour, replace the implementation like this:

```ts
export default class MyErrorHandler implements IHandleErrors {
  public async handleErrors(error: any): Promise<boolean> {
    return false;
  }
}
```

If you return `true` from your error handler, the SDK will not throw an error, and treat it as handleed, returning null from the request that triggered it. Returning false will re-throw the original error after your handler has run.

### redirectionStrategy

You can override the default redirection strategy by passing in a class that implements the `IRedirect` interface. By default, we use the `DocumentLocationRedirectionStrategy` class.

```ts
export default class DocumentLocationRedirectionStrategy
  implements IRedirectionStrategy
{
  public async redirect(targetUrl: string | URL): Promise<void> {
    document.location = targetUrl.toString();
  }

  public async onReturnFromRedirect(): Promise<void> {}
}
```

You might want to override this behaviour if you use a client side framework like React or Vue and you need to record some state, or trigger some operation before the redirect for oAuth / token exchange happens. For example - you might want to add something to localStorage that you can read back when the user returns to the application.

### cachingStrategy

You can override the default caching strategy by passing in a class that implements the `ICache` interface. By default, we use the `LocalStorageCachingStrategy` class.

```ts
interface ICachingStrategy {
  getOrCreate<T>(
    cacheKey: string,
    createFunction: () => Promise<T & ICachable & object>
  ): Promise<T & ICachable>;
  get<T>(cacheKey: string): (T & ICachable) | null;
  setCacheItem<T>(cacheKey: string, item: T & ICachable): void;
  remove(cacheKey: string): void;
}
```

We provide a default browser (localStorage) caching strategy and (TODO) a node in-memory caching strategy.
